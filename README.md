# 🎮 Guess the Number Game

A simple command-line game in Python where the computer picks a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it!

## 🧠 How It Works

- The number is randomly generated using Python’s `random` module.
- You get hints after each guess — whether the number is higher or lower.
- The game tracks the number of attempts.

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python guess_the_number.py
